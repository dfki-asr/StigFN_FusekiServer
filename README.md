# StigFN_FusekiServer
 
StigFN_Fuseki server implements SPARQL functions which model diffusion, linear decay as well as functions handling temporal and spatial aspects, for example, time difference between two time stamps and manhattan distances between two coordinates. This is used in the MTO scenario for the BIC-TA publication. Complete details on running this project can be seen [here](https://github.com/dfki-asr/StigLD-Demo)
